# ICFP2017 Artifact for: Low-Level Programming Embedded in F*


## This Docker Image

The present image was generated after a successful verification, extraction,
compilation and test run of:
- F\*, the programming language we use for all our proofs
- KreMLin, the tool that extracts Low\* programs to C
- miTLS, the in-progress, verified implementation of the TLS protocol
- HACL\*, the High Assurance Cryptographic Library


## Finding the proofs

In order of appearance in the paper:
- **Fig. 2, "A snippet from Chacha20"**:
  `hacl-star/code/salsa-family/Hacl.Impl.Chacha20.fst`:777 for the
  implementation, and `hacl-star/code/salsa-family/Chacha20.fsti` for the
  interface
- **2.2, Low\* heap model**:
  + `FStar/ulib/FStar.HyperHeap.fst`, for the definition of `rid`,
    `root`, etc.
  + `FStar/ulib/FStar.HyperStack.fst`, for the definition of
    `is_stack_region`, `sid`, the `mem` type, etc.
  + `FStar/ulib/hyperstack/FStar.ST.fst`, for the definition of
    `push_frame`, the allocation functions, the `Stack` and `StackInline`
    effects, etc.
- **2.2, Modeling arrays:**
  in `FStar/ulib/FStar.Buffer.fst`
- **2.2, Modeling structs:**
  in `FStar/ulib/FStar.Struct.fst`
- **2.2, Modeling structs, in-progress unified model of flat, inline arrays within
  structs:**
  in `FStar/ulib/FStar.StructNG.fst`
- **2.3, abstract limb type:**
  in `hacl-star/code/bignum/Hacl.Bignum.Limb.fst`, including the the definition
  of `v` and `eq_mask`
- **Fig. 3, Poly1305 bigint:**
  + since the paper was written, our Poly1305 version was ported to 64-bits; the
    new normalization functions are in `hacl-star/code/poly1305/Hacl.Bignum.Modulo.fst`, and
    the closest equivalent of `poly1305_mac` is `poly1305_last_pass_` in
    `hacl-star/code/poly1305/Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.fst`
  + we also include an older version of our codebase for reference purposes; the
    `normalize` function is in
    `FStar/examples/low-level/crypto/Crypto.Symmetric.Poly1305.Bignum.fst` and
    is called `finalize`; the `poly1305_mac` function is in
    `FStar/examples/low-level/crypto/Crypto.Symmetric.Poly1305.fst`:1083. 
    **Note:** this code no longer verifies, as this directory has been phased
    out in favor of the new, improved proofs in HACL\*
- **2.4, AEAD security proof:**
  the AEAD development has been integrated with the HACL* library; the
  top-level AEAD proof statement, `encrypt`, is in
  `hacl-star/secure-api/aead/Crypto.AEAD.Encrypt.fst`
- **2.4, StackInline**
  see `hacl-star/secure_api/uf1cma/Crypto.Symmetric.MAC.fst`:216, including an
  example of multiplexing, where we deal with different types of MACs depending
  on which algorithm is used. This pattern also extracts to C.


## Source code for our tools

- **4, the KreMLin tool:**
  the source of KreMLin are included in `kremlin`; of notable
  interest are the files
  `kremlin/src/Simplify.ml` (many rewriting passes),
  `kremlin/src/Inlining.ml` (inlining of the `StackInline` effect),
  `kremlin/src/DataTypes.ml` (compilation of data types and pattern
  matches),
  `kremlin/src/AstToCStar.ml` (the transformation from Î»ow\* to C\*)
- **F\*:**
  the sources of F\* are in `FStar/src`


## Running functional tests

The tests that best showcase our methodology are run via `make -C
hacl-star/test extract-c`. This targets extracts to C code our AEAD development,
along with a variety of cryptographic algorithms (x25519, poly1305, chacha20,
xsalsa20); this target also compiles and runs test executables such as
`secure_api/krml-test-{vale,hacl}.exe`.

Additional test targets not covered by `make -C hacl-star/test extract-c`
include:
- `make -C hacl-star/code/poly1305 poly1305.exe`: unit test for the Poly1305
  algorithm
- `make -C hacl-star/code/salsa-family chacha20.exe salsa20.exe`: unit test for
  the Chacha20 and Salsa20 algorithms.


## Running performance tests

### With GCC

One can extract HACL\* to a releasable set of C files, then run a
performance benchmark using GCC, via:

```
make -C hacl-star/test snapshot-gcc
LIBSODIUM_HOME=/usr/local LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib make -C hacl-star/test perf-gcc
```

### With CompCert

Due to licensing reasons, we do not believe we can safely redistribute CompCert
in this artefact evaluation image. We believe, however, one can easily install
CompCert via:

```
opam repo add coq-released http://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install -j 8 coq.8.6

wget http://compcert.inria.fr/release/compcert-3.0.1.tgz
tar xzvf compcert-3.0.1.tgz
cd CompCert-3.0.1
./configure x86_64-linux
make -j 8
sudo make install
```

One this is done, the following series of commands will run performance
benchmarks for CompCert:

```
make -C hacl-star/test snapshot-ccomp
LIBSODIUM_HOME=/usr/local LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib make -C hacl-star/test perf-ccomp
```

### Via the OpenSSL engine

A popular benchmarking tool is the OpenSSL "speed" command, which measures how
many operations of a given kind may be performed over a span of 3 seconds, for
different input sizes.

We wrote a new OpenSSL engine that packages some of our algorithms, meaning we
can measure their performance using the aforementioned testing framework. Right
now, the engine is set up so that our algorithms perform as many computations as
the OpenSSL ones, but due to some minor API differences, there remains some work
to ensure we compute the right result (e.g. detect when to perform the call to
Poly1305_Finalize according to the state machine of OpenSSL).

These tests can be run via `make -C hacl-star/test/openssl-engine test`.


## Replaying the proofs

One can replay the proofs by running the high-level command: `./everest verify
-j 8` where `8` is a suggested number of cores to use. One may want to allocate
more cores to their Docker instance.


# Regenerating this artefact

One can easily reconstruct this artefact from scratch, via:

```
git clone git@github.com:project-everest/everest
git checkout icfp2017aec
cd everest/.docker/everest
docker build
```

This takes a couple hours on a powerful machine.
