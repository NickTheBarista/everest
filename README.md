# Project Everest

A verified, efficient TLS implementation, in C.

See [the website](https://project-everest.github.io)!

## The `everest` script

This repository contains a script, `everest`, and a known working set of
revisions for all the sub-projects in Everest. The script will check that you
have a good working setup, and will fetch or update the projects accordingly.

## Pre-setup (Windows)

If you don't have a 64-bit Cygwin installed already, please download and run the
Cygwin 64-bit installer (along with Cygwin git), then launch this script from a
Cygwin prompt.

## Usage

See `./everest help`
