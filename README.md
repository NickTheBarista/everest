Non-anonymous supplementary materials for ICFP submission
=========================================================

Companion paper
---------------

The `companion-paper.pdf` file provides another paper by the same authors,
to appear at IEEE S&P'17. It describes the security proof of our TLS 1.3
implementation, and briefly mentions our toolchain and the performance results.

Proofs
------

The present directory contains the proof artefacts mentioned in our ICFP
submission. In order of appearance in the paper:
- **Fig. 2, "A snippet from Chacha20"**:
  `code/salsa-family/Hacl.Impl.Chacha20.fst`:777 for the implementation, and
  `code/salsa-family/Chacha20.fsti` for the interface
- **2.2, Low\* heap model**:
  + `dependencies/FStar/ulib/FStar.HyperHeap.fst`, for the definition of `rid`,
    `root`, etc.
  + `dependencies/FStar/ulib/FStar.HyperStack.fst`, for the definition of
    `is_stack_region`, `sid`, the `mem` type, etc.
  + `dependencies/FStar/ulib/hyperstack/FStar.ST.fst`, for the definition of
    `push_frame`, the allocation functions, the `Stack` and `StackInline`
    effects, etc.
- **2.2, Modeling arrays:**
  in `dependencies/FStar/ulib/FStar.Buffer.fst`
- **2.2, Modeling structs:**
  in `dependencies/FStar/ulib/FStar.Struct.fst`
- **2.2, Modeling structs, in-progress unified model of flat, inline arrays within
  structs:**
  in `dependencies/FStar/ulib/FStar.StructNG.fst`
- **2.3, abstract limb type:**
  in `code/bignum/Hacl.Bignum.Limb.fst`, including the the definition of `v` and
  `eq_mask`
- **Fig. 3, Poly1305 bigint:**
  + since the paper was written, our Poly1305 version was ported to 64-bits; the
    new normalization functions are in `code/poly1305/Hacl.Bignum.Modulo.fst`, and
    the closest equivalent of `poly1305_mac` is `poly1305_last_pass_` in
    `code/poly1305/Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.fst`
  + we also include an older version of
    our codebase for reference purposes; the `normalize` function is in
    `dependencies/FStar/examples/low-level/crypto/Crypto.Symmetric.Poly1305.Bignum.fst`
    and is called `finalize`; the `poly1305_mac` function is in
    `dependencies/FStar/examples/low-level/crypto/Crypto.Symmetric.Poly1305.fst`:1083.
- **2.4, AEAD security proof:**
  the AEAD development has not been integrated with the HACL* library yet; the
  top-level AEAD proof statement, `encrypt`, is in
  `dependencies/FStar/examples/low-level/crypto/Crypto.AEAD.Encrypt.fst`

Tools
-----

- **4, the KreMLin tool:**
  the source of KreMLin are included in `dependencies/kremlin`; of notable
  interest are the files
  `dependencies/kremlin/src/Simplify.ml` (many rewriting passes),
  `dependencies/kremlin/src/Inlining.ml` (inlining of the `StackInline` effect),
  `dependencies/kremlin/src/DataTypes.ml` (compilation of data types and pattern
  matches),
  `dependencies/kremlin/src/AstToCStar.ml` (the transformation from Î»ow\* to
  C\*)

Performance & running the code
------------------------------

Reproducing the performance measurements may be achieved in two different ways.
- One may follow the instructions in `INSTALL.md`.
- One may use our Docker image that comes with all the prerequisites for
  building all of our projects, via:
  `docker run projecteverest/everest-icfp2017 -it /bin/bash --login`, followed by
  `./everest pull make test`

As a proof that we have not pushed any commits to our image after the submission
deadline, we provide the git sha1 of the icfp2017 branch above:
`088da8f64070d72177dc4e5346f252842af68d0f`. We do not intend to leverage the recent
SHA1 collision attacks to push further commits.


# Project Everest

A verified, efficient TLS implementation, in C.

See [the website](https://project-everest.github.io)!

## The `everest` script

The role of this script is to:
- check that your development environment is sane;
- fetch known good revisions of miTLS, F\*, KreMLin, Vale and HACL
- run the voodoo series of commands that will lead to a successful build
- run whatever is known to be working tests.

For developers, this script also allows you to:
- record a new known set of good revisions.

This script is used heavily by [continuous
integration](https://github.com/project-everest/everest-ci) to pull, build &
test project everest.

## Pre-setup (Windows)

If you don't have a 64-bit Cygwin installed already, please download and run the
Cygwin 64-bit installer (along with Cygwin git), then launch this script from a
Cygwin prompt.

Install the production scons for Windows from this [share](http://scons.org/pages/download.html). After install, ensure that scons.bat is in the system path. 

## Usage

See `./everest help`

## Contributing

We welcome pull requests to this script, using the usual fork project + pull
request GitHub model. For members of Everest, Jonathan Protzenko has the keys
to the everest project on GitHub and can grant write permissions on this
repository so that you can develop your feature in a branch directly. To be a member of the Everest team with access to the build system, please contact Jonathan for more info. Jonathan watches pull requests and will provide timely feedback unless he's on vacations
or in another timezone.
